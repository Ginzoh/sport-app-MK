# Project 12 - Front-end Dashboard - Made By KRAUTH Mickael

# Vite React App

This project is a Vite-powered React app featuring visualizations using Recharts. The app displays a variety of charts based on user data, including bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and radar charts.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 14.x or higher
- npm 6.x or higher (comes bundled with Node.js)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Vite React app on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/Ginzoh/sport-app-MK`

`cd sport-app-MK`

2. Install the dependencies:

npm install


3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following line:

`VITE_REACT_APP_MOCK=FALSE`


Set the value to `TRUE` if you want to use mock data instead of the API.

4. Start the development server:

npm run dev

This command starts the Vite development server at `http://localhost:5173`. Open your browser and navigate to the URL to see the app running.
