# CustomRadarChart Component Documentation

The ``CustomRadarChart`` component is a custom radar chart built using the Recharts library. This component accepts data and displays a radar chart with custom ticks, grid, and styling. The chart provides an intuitive visualization of multi-dimensional data.

## Props

| Name | Type | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| dataD | Array of Objects | Data to be displayed in the radar chart. Each object in the array should have a kind property (string) and a value property (number). | Yes |

## Usage
Here's an example of how to use the ``CustomRadarChart`` component:

```jsx
import CustomRadarChart from './graph/CustomRadarChart';

const data = [
  { value: 80, kind: 'cardio' },
  { value: 120, kind: 'energy' },
  // ...
];

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <CustomRadarChart dataD={data} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Replace the ``userId`` variable with the desired user ID from the ``USER_PERFORMANCE`` data. The chart will display the data accordingly.

## Customization

If you need to customize the appearance or functionality of the ``CustomRadarChart`` component, you can do so by modifying the component's code. Be cautious when making changes, as they may affect the component's responsiveness and overall appearance.
